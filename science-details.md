# Science details

Because of the multiscale / distributed nature of the endeavor, it seems the science should focus on a few key aspect of math and logics : Logic, Algebra, Category Theory, Homotopy, Probability/Statistics, Graphs and Networks seem like a good start.

Some content need to be assembled that links all these topics together, and present them in an interactive way, for a self-learning student to be able learn from it by doing. We should here leverage the PDF/Web/TTY standards trinity.

Since this will likely be the base for anything we will do, it should eventually be replicated, translated, and people should ideally self-organize to collaborate on it.

Regarding Mathematical models for interactive knowledge, programming language paradigms is a good place to start investigating : 

* Imperative language are the most intuitive at first, but they probably need to be tuned to specific cultures and needs. These will be the ones used locally, by one or a few individuals
* Functional languages are more formal and provide nice guarantees in a larger scale, but their complexity means they are usable by less people, and should probably be favored at the city / city interface
* Probabilistic languages have a more interesting semantics for large groups of people and should probably be used between countries. But they need to rely on the formal and functional languages used between cities in orders to not drop any guarantees provided by these languages.
