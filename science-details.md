# Science details

Because of the multiscale / distributed nature of the endaevour, it seems the science should focus on a few key aspect of math and logics : Logic, Algebra, Category Theory, Homotopy, Probability/Statistics, Graphs and Networks seem like a good start.

Some content need to be assembled that links all these topics together, and present them in an interractive way, for a self-learning student to be able learn from it by doing. We should here leverage the PDF/Web/TTY trinity.

Since this will likely be the base for anything we will do, it should eventually be replicated, translated, and people should ideally self-organize to collaborate on it...
