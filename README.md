# Preface

I have always been fascinated by science fiction. When I was a child, it sounded more like science, but getting older it feels more and more like a fiction.

It may be because of time passing by, and realizing the difficulty of transmitting knowledge and experience acquired to younger generations. It may also be because humans have grown so numerous that all resources are quickly running dry, and noone knows what will be left in a few decades.

When noone is there to teach the young, knowledge is lost. And if the middle ages showed us one thing, it is that knowledge, once lost can take centuries to revocer, hence wasting time in the grand scheme of things. As living entities, time is our most precious, most limited resource, second only to life.

Hence the urgency nowadays is not about how do we avoid the impeding doom, as most of the objective datasets show that we can't, but how to we soften the blow, and speed up recovery. The core of this idea is that we need to safeguard our knowledge, and the way to passively \(potentially without living teacher\) transmit it to younger generations.

In this book I will therefore attempt to describe the way that seems the most likely to sustain catastrophic world-scale challenges, and eventually succeed in transmitting knowledge to descendants a few generations after us.
