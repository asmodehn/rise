# Distributed Backup

To be able to come back from a destructive large scale event on earth, we should encode our knowledge on another place: the Moon. 

Besides being, at the moment, reachable by mankind, it is quite stable, visible by people, and has everyday tangible effect on people lives \(tides for example\). After a catastrophic event on earth, if some of us survive, it seems reasonable to assume there will still be someone to look at the Moon.

But how shall we encode that knowledge ? The Moon is visible by people on earth because it reflects the sun's light. It is therefore thinkable to comeup with some encoding via lighting, where sometime the light will be reflected and some time it will not... Moon phases give us the opportunity to do this in a way that is visible from anywhere on the ground, but the scale of endaevour necessary remains to be researched however.

Also the Moon being a somewhat large visible object, it is thinkable, that each continent pick a different position that is best suited for him. Given how it is difficult for various entities to agree on such a large scale, this is a good opportunity.

At the continent scale, neighbouring countries need to agree on some way to exchange knowledge and share common values, that can then be replicated to be stored in each of these countries. Centralization is a more efficient use of energy, therefore centralizing the long term, potentially complex, knowledge at the level of countries seems the best approach. For human organization, a central decision place \(with an optional backup\) is the way it has been done in history, so it makes sense for this centralization of knowledge to be not too far from what we call "the capital of a country".

However for the "short-term practical knowledge", this should be as close as possible from the people, therefore probably centralized in cities. Maintaining knowledge over time is also energy intensive so how this is done, and what will be the necessary materials/energy flow in and out of the city are likely to be specific to each location.
