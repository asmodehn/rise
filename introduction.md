# Introduction

Humans, like any living agent in a group, constitute a very complex system. The drives and basic instincts of a living agents evolve to ensure survival. One of them is to maximize short term personal gain and the current paradigm in which our societies live nowadays, in transition between the second to the third millennia, has been modeled to support and exploit this very instinctive urge.

This makes sense in an uncertain environment for an individual, as one will try to maximize the resources he holds, for in case of emergency, have some resources close-by for immediate consumption.

On the other hand, as a large group, we also have to share resources, and accept that the group needs to slowly build some excess of resoures, for the benefit of the group itself, to be able to survive in case of larger environmental stress. There are of course conditions before one agent can accept this, and these may be different for everyone. Resources have to be close by, they have to not be needed immediately, etc. This is what politics should be ultimately about. 

Therefore there will always be tensions, inside one group, between the individuals themselves and between an individual and the group as a whole. At larger scale this pattern seems to repeat as well, where smaller groups will try to hoard resources for their own use, and the larger group of which they are a part of will try to store extra resources for harder times.

However the current generation of people in the developed countries has not known harder times, and the tendency now is very individualistic, everyone \(a person, not a group !\) trying to hoard resources, neglecting the larger group, that seems more and more unworthy of sacrificing resources we could have right now. The blame is likely shared, individuals feeling they are more entitled than they have ever been, and "individuals in charge" for the larger group being more and more short-term sighted, and focusing on personal gain.

However, just like ants trying to move forward in unknown grounds, we should not waste time and resources trying to find someone to blame, as it is likely not one person, and instead figure out on how do we, as a group, get out of this conundrum.
