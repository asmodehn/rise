# Scales

Once we have a clearer understanding of what we are trying to achieve locally, at our individual scale, we should, to be truly sustainable, scale out to a larger perspective, and try there to attempt the same feat: safeguarding knowledge.

But what is the scale, how many times, on planet earth, can we scale until it becomes unpractical ? the answer to this question could be in our own capabilities, developed in us after millennia of evolution. Dunbar's Number seems to be a good enough starting point for this thought exercise, and historical records of cities' population gives a good expectations for the scale of cities on a longer time scale.

* 1 individual by itself can probably not sustain such knowledge \(and associated efforts\)
* 10 individuals together is too limited a group in case of troubles, and people instinctively will feel it, they will attempt to get out of the group.
* 100 individuals is still a small number, but we can start to organize as a group \(there will be leaders in various fields, and followers\), and the group has some chance to survive over time.
* 1000 individuals starts to be enough to develop knowledge and grow as a culture
* 10k individuals seems to be the required amount for stable long term, and diverse enough to grow \(albeit slowly\) from each other experiences.
* 100k individuals seems to be the population of large cities in the antiquity, and therefore there might be some kind of "size limits" after which a city is not sustainable any longer.
* 1000k individuals start to be the size of a nation, encompassing multiple interconnected cities, so we also have an "intermediate layer" as a city is an agent in the larger country system
* 10M individuals is the population of continents in the relatively recent Roman Empire, therefore an already advanced civilization
* 100M individuals is the scale of the world population around 2000 years ago, with developed agriculture in various part of the world.
* 1000M individuals is probably the scale we can aim at in a world where all energy sources have been exhausted.

By this very simple, and grossly inaccurate exercise we have seen that we should already consider multiple scales, in population and in area covered:

* individual : 1
* city: 10k \(close individual interactions\)
* country: 1M \(political/army influence\)
* continent: 10M \(access to geographical resources\)
* earth: 1000M \(upper bound\)

The best and simplest way to preserve knowledge stored in case of catastrophic event is to duplicate it:

* An individual can teach someone else or co-learn by sharing similar experiences
* A city can maintain a learning infrastructure, and attempt to convince other cities to duplicate it
* A country can maintain an "inter-city" infrastructure, and attempt to convince other countries to duplicate it, with various changes given political environment.
* Each continent will have its own geographical oddities, and the infrastructure of one will need to be adapted before it s outcome in one continent can be duplicated in another.
* Earth is currently our only home. The only chance of a backup we have, could maybe be the moon...
