# Focus

We now know that we need to safeguard knowledge and a way to transmit it. But what is it that we need to safeguard ? where do we event start ? and how can we possibly transmit to someone later on ?

Arguably the root of knowledge and its transmission is "language". We will probably not be able to safeguard all languages, and as language is tied to culture, safeguarding a culture is also tricky, as it keep changing.

But we can try to get to the simplest core model of this, and attempt to somehow encode this for later generation to be able to recover. Linguistics and Maths likely contain the elements necessary for this. 

And how to encode it ? we need a format that is robust, not prone to change, and that later generation will be able to gather knowledge from. In the past, civilization wrote onto paper, and stone, their knowledge in order for it to survive. This is still the case nowadays and probably the most useful of our mathematical tools for thought should be written in stone.

But current technology, that will still be around for the foreseeable years \(decades if we are lucky ?\) give us another : data stored in computers. Because computers are such versatile tools, they provide a very efficient medium for independent learning, provided that the content is made for this purpose. Another advantage is that computing is heavily based on maths \(which we already aim to safeguard\). And last important advantage, is that a computer is able to simulate large group of independent agents, therefore simulate models of cultures and systems co-evolving.

Armed with this knowledge we now need to come up with a "core mathematical programming language" that teach itself, and attempt to bootstrap computing from it. Then we need to build a computer in materials that are cheap but can survive for a long time \(the opposite of disposability/recyclability !\). That computer should also probably be visual and physical for people to instinctively re-learn the mathematical model from physical objects if needed.

Then we end up with three complementary goals on our hands:  
- a mathematical theory that model computing, ie the transformation of information, and is expressible via a "language" as universal as possible.  
- a mechanical computer from which people could potentially centuries later understand the concepts  
- a electrical computer, for efficiency in learning, while we are still able to build one.

Each of these need to encode the two others in one form or another... With this it seems we can have a base on which to build upon:  
- simulate people, social groups, cultures, environments, to provide an immediate explicit link between math and everyday life \(calendars, etc.\)  
- store data as external memory, for later retrieval and long-term learning  
- experimentation platform for short-term interactive learning
