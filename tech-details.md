# Tech details

By Tech we mean the physical side of things : how to build and maintain computers, how to maximize their use for learning by humans.

History gives us calculator. These are even mechanically feasible. They seem to be a good grounding for everyday use among people, since most of us enjoy \(and sometime truly need\) assistance for counting, almost on a daily basis.

This means that, at the city level, we need some way to make sure the calculators, as well as books, and interactive media \(web\) are trustworthy, in the sense that they dont contain anything malicious that could cripple the city knowledge network. Various software tooling can be deployed for this, some of them could be provided by the country.

In the same sense, timekeeping should be available directly from the city, with an optional coordination at the country level. But each city should be able to somehow verify its time relative to the postion of stars \(including the sun\)

At the country level we need mathematical tooling that can help verify software, and more advanced software language \(the kind that can verify itself\), even if they are to be used by just a few highly trained people.

Also history showed us that calendar and meteorology were critical in order to adapt to the passing of season and for agriculture. It seems suitable that these be done at the country level, and replicated / correlated between countries.

Between countries we need to be able to heavily connect the differnet centers in the sort that even if a link is severred, multiple other transitive links are still available, and can be put to use almost instantenously.
