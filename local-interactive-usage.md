# Local Interactive Usage

Once we have examinated the various scales we can see that there are two different scales that have both long term backup and immediate usage responsibilities:

* the city
* the country

Continents are mainly there to organise resources at the large scale to make the Moon backup a reality, but the use of knowledge will probably be similar to the one done in a country.

Individuals will be in contact with the city hosted knowledge and need only to focus on immediate interactive learning. Their capacity to safeguard knowledge is quite limited \(write books\)

We will therefore focus on these two scales, and detail a bit more the focus on what we actually are trying to preserver, and how people interact with it.
