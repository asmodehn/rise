# Local Interactive Usage

Once we have examined the various scales we can see that there are two different scales that have both long term backup and immediate usage responsibilities:

* the city \(10k individuals\)
* the country \(1M individuals\)

Continents are mainly there to organize resources at the large scale to make the Moon backup a reality, but the use of knowledge will probably be similar to the one done in a country.

Individuals will be in contact with the city hosted knowledge and need only to focus on immediate interactive learning. Their capacity to safeguard and transfer knowledge, although necessary, is quite limited in reach \(write books and teach\)

We will therefore focus on these two scales, and detail a bit more the focus on what we actually are trying to preserve, and how people interact with it. We will treat their neighbouring layer as just another scale, but with only one interface.

For the immediate interactive usage, there is the very local, very individual one \(one person with one computer\), as well as a collective one \(a group of 10k people with one computer - potentially more complex and physically distributed\). Given that people first means of communication is language, and that we had centuries to teach everyone written language, the first mandatory interfaces, along with a current standard are PDF and web \(HTML/CSS\). Since they need to be interactive, it is important that annotating PDF is possible \("drawing style" like what Xournal allows\), and web content must be interactive \(Jupyter-notebook style\). History also showed us that another interface was a necessary step along the way : The Interactive Terminal \(TTY\). 

For collaboration on the 10k scale, what is currently available as online tools can come in handy \(svn, git, file servers, etc.\). The difficulty here is to choose or define standards that make sense at this scale, but here the main concern is network structure. To be efficient a network in a city can be wired, but to be flexible there is also the possibility to mesh intuitively, given the short distances...

At the city scale, some representives of the people in a city could get access to the more advanced country-wide knowledge, potentially using more advanced language and more costly paradigm. What comes to mind here is leveraging Formal methods as using a country-wide available Verification Server for example... It is an example of an advanced feature where extensive knowledge is necessary, and is mandatory in some specific cases.

At the country scale, we want to replicate \(and potentially translate !\) knowledge from other countries. Countries then need to work together on automatic translation systems to ease the burden from humans, and this can be the duty of a continental entity if there is one... Remember timescale is slower here. Also the country knowledge base should be backed up on the Moon, and be able to eventually retrieve data from the Moon, by safely keeping \(and keeping allies as backup\) knowledge of the way to decode signals from there.
